        <p>AThe International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures (IASS) and Structrual Membranes are organizing a joint symposium in October 2019. The symposium will take place from 7 to 10 october 2019 in Barcelona, Spain. The conference venue is at the crown plaza hotel. It is located close to the medieval city center of Barcelona and venue of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition with a the famous German pavilion by Mies van de Rohe. Barcelona is one leading tourist, economic, trade fair, cultural and architectural centers of the world.</p>
        <p>The conference website can be found at: <a target="view_window" href="http://congress.cimne.com/formandforce2019/frontal/default.asp">http://congress.cimne.com/formandforce2019/frontal/default.asp</a></p>
        <p>The expo website and opportunities for sponsoring can be found at:<a target="view_window" href="http://www.manufacturingmaterials.org/">http://www.manufacturingmaterials.org </a></p>

        <h3>&nbsp<br>Theme and Topics </h3>
      
          <p>The theme of the 2019 symposium will be Form and force. In this symposium we aim to connect academia, companies by organizing an exposition during the symposium. Academics and companies are invited to design, build and expose innovative structures. The challenge that the organizers set is to present step-changing new concepts that will lead to a better, innovative world and a better build environment. Special attention will be given to design, engineering, construction, operation and maintenance of shell and spatial structures as well as the potential impact that digital technology and BIM can have and has on the built environment and how we can improve our built environment with this technology.</p>
        
        
        <h3>&nbsp<br>&nbsp<br>Previous Conferences</h3>

          <p>The IASS symposia rotates over the world since the 1960s. Previous conference venues have been Brazil (2013), Seoul (2012), London (2011), Shanghai (2010), Hamburg2017 and Boston (2018). The structural membranes symposia were located in Barcelona, Stuttgart and Munich.</p>

        <h3>&nbsp<br>&nbsp<br>Visitors Profile </h3>

          <p>Visitors come from all over the world from a variety of sectors: Art, Architecture, Engineering (Civil and Structural) and Construction. We have attendees from companies, government and academia. Our regular conference visitors include executive level management from large architecture, engineering and construction firms involved in key projects all over the world: stadia, tall and large buildings, bridges, infrastructure and other large projects. We pay special attention to a maximum synergy between companies and academics with a special focus to developers, building installations advisors and contractors, building owners, etc.</p>

        <h3>&nbsp<br>Exposition and Design Contest</h3>
        <p>Before and during the symposium an exposition will be on display which will include the best entries of an international design contest. This exposition will feature objects from the domain of membrane, shell and spatial structures. The contest is open for everybody. This contest is organized by WG21 in close cooperation with the symposium organizers. More information can be found on the website of WG21: <a href="http://www.manufacturingmaterials.org/">http://www.manufacturingmaterials.org</a></p>
